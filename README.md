![](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,js,html,css,eclipse,linux)

The project (completed in 2019) is developed through a virtual machine equipped with a Linux system, and users on the published spatial data portal are allowed to log in, query and modify related data. This project aims to apply related skills developed on the back-end and front-end to GEOINT processing.

## Basic Funtions
* Development of the "China Geographic National Conditions Data Visualization Platform";

* Creating APIs that can access the database through back-end programming;
  
* Creating functions to query and modify the database using JSON strings to perform basic web back-end development;

* Debugging WSGI applications;

* Creating user login interfaces and making JavaScript code hidden from copying or revealing sensitive information.

## PS.
This Subject Project was done in collaboration with two other French colleagues, thanks to Cl√©ment Dujardin and Antoine Ducasse for their support.

The project was completed hastily in a hurry due to the tight schedule and rushed time, so there may be some confusion or errors in the codes, please understand!
